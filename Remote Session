# How to take remote session in a domain environment

By default ExecutionPolicy is enabled in Windows Server 2012, and the policy is set to RemoteSigned, and now question arises what is RemoteSigned. Please refer Execution Policy under @PowerShellFun

Before working on this, make sure you have enabled remote session 

Type : Enable-PSSession -Force to activate WinRM service and restart the WinRM service by typing Restart-Service WinRM ;-) You are good to go.

Login into Powershell as an admin and type or copy paste the below command

Enter-PSSession -Computer . -Credentials DOMAINNAME\USER_NAME 

. -> Referes to local computer

Enter-PSSession -Computer X.X.X.X -Credentials DOMAINNAME\USER_NAME 

X.X.X.X -> Refers to IP Address

Enter-PSSession -Computer COMPUTERNAME -Credentials DOMAINNAME\USER_NAME 

COMPUTERNAME -> You can enter computername, make sure DNS is set and working fine :-)
