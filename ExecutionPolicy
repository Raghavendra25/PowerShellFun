There are different types of ExecutionPolicy in powershell:

 1.Restricted 
     -> This policy allows a user to run runtime commands, however, will not be able to run scripts no matter the script is location in           local or Administrator. 
 2.Unresctricted
    -> This policy runs on powershell window regardless of wheather they are signed or not from trusted publisher
 3.RemoteSigned 
    -> By default this policy is set in Windows Server 2012
    -> Scripts which are downloaded from anywhere must be signed from a trusted publisher
    -> Scripts created local need not be signed 
 4.AllSigned
    -> This policy allows a script to run as long as they are digitally signed by trusted policy
    -> Within this policy, when you attempt to run a signed script, you will receive a prompt stating do you trust this publisher 
    -> Then you can run the script
